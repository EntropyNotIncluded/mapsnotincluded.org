This is a test idea, as writing a mod for world generation seems to be a little out of my depth at the moment, there are plenty of save-parsers we can use. We just need to generate saves. Going to see if we can write some code to automatically do this via PyAutoGui or ahk

This is less than ideal and really we would want a mod that injects.
