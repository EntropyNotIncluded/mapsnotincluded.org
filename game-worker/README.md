This is a test idea, as writing a mod for world generation seems to be a little out of my depth at the moment, there are plenty of save-parsers we can use. We just need to generate saves. Going to see if we can write some code to automatically do this via PyAutoGui or ahk

This is less than ideal and really we would want a mod that injects.

When evaluating the save files it looks like (oni-save-parser)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/oni-save-parser] is able to extract most of the data, if we expand it and save it, it works out to be 17MB from a 750KB save. Either we can extract what we feel is useful, i.e seed, geyser locations etc or we can just keep a copy of the save file. We will probably end up doing both, as the extracted data will be useful for querying, while the raw saves serve as a potential future database if we're interested in more stuff.
