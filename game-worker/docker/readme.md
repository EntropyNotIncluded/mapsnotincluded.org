This is a test project to see if we can get oni working in a docker container, this is so we could scale the generation worker. 

This doesnt currently work, even though openGL and Nvidia is supported oni is crashing with a bad opengl error. I believe this is due to accessing through VNC, so I was trying to get TurboVNC to work, but thats where I stopped and instead just set up a VirtualBox VM since its only me.
